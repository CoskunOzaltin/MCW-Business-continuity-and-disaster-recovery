### Task 5: Create Azure Resource Groups

In this task, you will select **Primary** and **Secondary** Azure regions that will be used for the remainder of the BCDR HOL. The **Primary** region should be able to **support V3 virtual machine** sizes, and then you should select the **Secondary** region based on the region pair assigned by Microsoft. Use the Products available by region webpage to determine your **Primary** site: <https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/regions/services/>. Once you have selected the Primary site,  review the BCDR page to find your Primary Site's Region Pair: <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/best-practices-availability-paired-regions>.

> **Note:** The examples in this HOL Guide use the following regions: **Primary:** East US 2 and **Secondary**: Central US. For this lab be sure to use these regions as they are validated to work with all the Azure features / services used throughout this lab.

1. From the **LABVM**, open Internet Explorer and connect to the Azure portal at: <https://portal.azure.com>.

2. Select **Resource groups**, then select **+Add**.

    ![On the Azure Portal Resource groups blade, the Add button is selected.](images/Setup/image23.png "Azure Portal, Resource groups blade")

3. Complete the **Resource group** blade using the following inputs and select **Review + Create** and **Create**:

    - **Resource group name**: `BCDRIaaSPrimarySite`
    - **Subscription**: Select your subscription.
    - **Resource group location**: **East US 2** (Primary region)

    ![In the Resource group blade, fields are set to the previously defined settings.](images/Setup/image24.png "Resource group blade")

    > **Note:** It's very important to use these exact names. Changing the names of the Resource groups will impact the HOL setup and could cause you not to be able to complete the lab.

4. Select **Resource groups**, then select **+Add**.

    ![On the Azure Portal Resource groups blade, the Add button is selected.](images/Setup/image23.png "Azure Portal, Resource groups blade")

5. Complete the **Resource group** blade using the following inputs and select **Review + Create** and **Create**.

    - **Resource group name**: `BCDRIaaSSecondarySite`
    - **Subscription**: Select your subscription.
    - **Resource group location**: **Central US** (Secondary region)

        ![In the Resource group blade, fields are set to the previously defined settings.](images/Setup/image25.png "Resource group blade")

6. Continue to add the resource groups below to support the HOL:

    | **Resource Group Name** | **Location** |
    |----------|-------------|
    | **BCDRAzureAutomation** | Any available site (other than your Primary or Secondary) regions |
    | **BCDRAzureSiteRecovery** | **Central US** (Secondary) |
    | **BCDROnPremPrimarySite** | **East US 2** (Primary) |
    | **BCDRPaaSPrimarySite** | **East US 2** (Primary) |
    | **BCDRPaaSSecondarySite** | **Central US** (Secondary) |

7. Once all the resource groups have been created, review all the resource groups for this HOL. **It is critical to ensure that the spelling is correct and that they are in the correct Azure Regions (Primary or Secondary)**.

    > **Note:** If for some reason there is an error, delete the erroneous resource group  and recreate it.

8. Here is the Azure Portal with each of the resource groups created in the correct Azure Region:

    ![In the Resource groups blade, various resource groups and their locations are listed.](images/Setup/image26.png "Resource groups blade")

You should follow all steps provided *before* starting the Hands-on Lab.
